# Denpasar Weather Forecast Using Machine Learning Methods
Indonesia, with its diverse weather, is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Due to global warming, the rainy season, which typically occurs from October to April with peak rainfall in December, has become increasingly unpredictable. This erratic weather pattern disrupts the daily lives of Indonesian citizens. Leveraging modern machine learning techniques, weather predictions can now be made more accurately. This project uses Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict the weather in Denpasar, Bali, for the year 2019. Among the models, the Decision Tree with max_depth=15 proved to be more effective. However, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics indicate that further improvements are needed for fully accurate weather predictions.

## Additional Information
This code was developed as part of my final project for the Machine Learning course. The project involves applying Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to predict weather patterns, showcasing the use of supervised learning techniques to analyze and forecast climate data. This work fulfills the requirements of the course and demonstrates practical machine learning applications.
