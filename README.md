# Denpasar Weather Forecast Using Machine Learning Methods
As a country with diverse weather, Indonesia is one of the many countries that are  vulnerable to climate change. As the result of global warming, the rainy season which should occur from October to April with the peak of rain occurring in December is becoming increasingly erratic. This event then disrupts the daily lives of Indonesian citizens, either directly or indirectly. With the creation of new knowledge today, the weather for the next few days can now be predicted using machine learning. In this study, the authors conducted research using the decision tree and random forest methods to predict the weather in Denpasar, Bali in 2019. Of the two models, the more effective classification method to use is the decision tree with max_depth = 15. However, according to the precision, recall, and f1-score the model is not yet fully effective in predicting the weather.

## Additional Information
This code was developed as part of my final project for the Machine Learning course. The project involves applying Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to predict weather patterns, showcasing the use of supervised learning techniques to analyze and forecast climate data. This work fulfills the requirements of the course and demonstrates practical machine learning applications.
